JAVA and JDK setup

Currently our system supports jdk version 1.8 only as to be compatible for mfin and hrm to run.

First install java 1.7 in your system by locating 1.7file in the file server.

Steps to install 1.7 
    1. Install java 1.8 from following commands steps
1. sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
2. java -version
3.  In your output you will see:

Output
openjdk version "1.8.0_312"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_312-8u312-b07-0ubuntu1~20.04-b07)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.312-b07, mixed mode)

    2. Glassfish setup in your local area.
3.1 Copy the glassfish setup in your home directory
3.2 now run command	
 $	cd /home/glassfish 3/glassfish/bin
 $         sudo bash asadmin start-domain domain1
If errors occurs such that 1.7 jdk is not install or found reinstall it
 
Then head over to following path
 Cd /home/glassfish3/glassfish/config/ 
Edit the asenv.conf and add following lines at last
This path and your 1.7jdk path should be the same.
AS_JAVA=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7.0_80/jre..
AS_JAVA=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.7.0_80/

After that again run the command to start domain


Then go to Mozilla firefox and paste this link:-
